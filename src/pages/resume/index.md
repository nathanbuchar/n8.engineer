## Experience

**Dropbox / HelloSign**
Senior Software Engineer
Oct 2017 – present

In my role as one of only two dedicated frontend engineers in an engineering team of 30, I lay the groundwork for all new frontend projects, setting the standard for all other engineers to follow. Additionally:

* I led the frontend development effort of a new single-page application for Enterprise customers. This project was built from the ground up using more modern techniques and involved collaboration from more than a dozen peers over the course of a year.

* I'm personally responsible for owning multiple tools, including Sentry, as well as maintaining several of HelloSign's open source repositories.

* I mentor junior engineers and help troubleshoot frontend issues on a daily basis.

* I author my team's frontend interview questions and challenges, and I help assess engineering candidates during the interview process.

* I lead my office's emergency response team, coordinating with the larger Dropbox physical security effort. Our team is often used as a model by Dropbox when training new floor wardens.
