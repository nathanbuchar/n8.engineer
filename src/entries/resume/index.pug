      I'm a frontend software engineer at Dropbox. My best work explores JavaScript standards and performance, best practices, and Node.js. He’s most passionate about solving puzzles and making things that other developers use to make things.

      I also ballroom dance and have a pet pigeon named Sophia.

            HelloSign was acquired by Dropbox in February of 2019, and has since been its fastest growing line of business. In my role as one of only two dedicated frontend engineers in an engineering team of 30, I help to lay the groundwork for all new frontend projects, setting the standard for all other engineers to follow. Additionally:

            - I led the frontend development effort of a new single-page application for Enterprise customers. This project was built from the ground up using more modern techniques and involved collaboration from more than a dozen peers over the course of a year.
            - I rewrote one of HelloSign's core libraries from the ground up to be much more robust and developer friendly using modern web standards and APIs.
            - I'm the lead maintainer on several of HelloSign's open source projects where I coordinate with our API Support team to handle issues, pull requests, and releases.
            - I mentor junior engineers and help troubleshoot frontend issues on a daily basis.
            - I author my team's frontend interview questions and challenges, and am a major contributor when assessing frontend engineering skills during the interview process.
            - I lead my office's emergency response team, coordinating with the larger Dropbox physical security effort.
            - I run a weekly recognition award called "The Bird." Once a week it's passed by the previous week's winner to a co-worker they want to recognize for going above and beyond the call of duty.
